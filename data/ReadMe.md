# Data

We conducted all our experiments on two different data sets. The first data set is a synthetic data set that shares statistical similarities to a real list: the password list has an overlap of approx. 92\% with a public password leak called "rockyou" \cite{rockyou_list}. The second data set is a real list from a Law Enforment Agency (for which we cannot provide details due to security reasons).
