# Data

We conducted all our experiments on two different data sets. We can only publish one in this repo, which is a synthetic data set that shares statistical similarities to a real list: the password list has an overlap of approx. 92\% with a public password leak called "rockyou". The second data set is a real list from a Law Enforment Agency, for which we cannot provide details due to security reasons.
